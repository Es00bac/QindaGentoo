# The QindaOffice repository is not published yet, so this is a local,
# immutable snapshot rather than a download. The operator produces the
# archive from the exact reviewed commit with the tree's own script:
#
#     tools/make-dist.sh 0.1.0_p20260919 /var/cache/distfiles
#
# That script refuses to run on a dirty tree and vendors the QXlsx
# submodule INTO the tarball, which is what makes the build work under
# FEATURES=network-sandbox: src_unpack fetches nothing. The archive also
# carries a .dist-commit file naming the commit it was cut from.
#
# The archive is named after PF, not P: a re-cut on the same day is a new
# revision with DIFFERENT contents, and ${P}.tar.xz would hand two of them
# the same distfile name and the same Manifest line.
RESTRICT="fetch"

# gui-wm/qindaqt-desktop owns the QindaQt global-menu static archives, the
# design-token and theme libraries and their headers, which office_quick
# links (no CMake package configs are installed for them, hence the
# find_library use in CMakeLists.txt). dev-libs/qindatk is the toolkit the
# whole suite's UI is built from (M31, D-031) and dev-qt/qtdeclarative the
# QtQuick it needs.
#
# qtbase[widgets] stays: nothing in the suite is a QWidget any more, but
# QtPrintSupport links QtWidgets and the suite prints through QPrinter.
#
# Qt Charts is optional (QQO_WITH_CHARTS) and only needed by the chart
# features. Qt Svg is not: the suite ships its icons as scalable SVG only,
# and the top-level find_package lists Svg as REQUIRED.
